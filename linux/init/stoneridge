### THESE ITEMS APPLY ONLY TO STONE RIDGE SERVERS
# What data rate to shape the interface to
RATE=10mbit

# MAXBURST and LIMIT help to smooth traffic out over a full bucket period,
# to prevent things from being bursty. MAXBURST should be equal to RATE

# What sort of latency to have on the interface.
LATENCY=90ms

# JITTER and CORRELATION control jitter on the interface. JITTER is the
# average number of ms of jitter, while CORRELATION is how similar a packet's
# actual jitter will be to the previous packet's jitter

### THESE ITEMS APPLY ONLY TO STONE RIDGE CLIENTS
# These are the IP addresses and ethernet MAC addresses for each of the
